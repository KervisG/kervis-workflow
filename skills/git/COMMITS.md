## Rules

- Use Conventional Commits.
- One intent per commit (keep commits small and focused).
- Do not commit secrets (.env, tokens, credentials).
- Do not add AI attribution (no "Co-Authored-By", no "Generated by AI").

## Format

```
type(scope)!: short imperative summary

Optional body (why + key decisions)

Optional footer (BREAKING CHANGE: ...)
```

### Types

- feat: new user-facing capability
- fix: bug fix
- refactor: behavior-preserving code change
- perf: performance improvement
- docs: documentation-only
- test: add/update tests
- chore: tooling/maintenance
- build: build system/deps
- ci: CI changes
- style: formatting only (no behavior change)
- revert: revert a commit

### Scope

PREFER:
- Use a short scope when it adds clarity (examples: cli, rules, ui, data, auth, deps).
- Omit scope if it does not help.

### Subject line

REQUIRE:
- Imperative mood: "add", "fix", "remove", "refactor".
- Keep it concise.
- No trailing period.

## Examples

```text
feat(cli): scaffold AGENTS.md into projects
fix(ui): prevent table overflow on mobile
chore(rules): add responsive Tailwind requirements
docs(skills): document React 19 form actions with Zod validation
refactor(auth): move token parsing into adapter boundary
build(deps): update zod to v4
```

## Pre-commit Checklist

- git status is clean except intended files
- git diff looks correct
- git diff --cached matches what you want to commit
- Run relevant checks (lint/typecheck/tests) when applicable
